Let's implement an access control system based on cards where each card is identified by its 48bit serial number
	b0 | b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 | b5
and it's access level, αα, 0x00-0xff.
Let there be a file 'input' which contains all of the cards in this format
	αα | b0 | b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 | b5 | αα | b0 | b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 | b5 | …
up to 256 cards and their access levels αα.
On stdin you'll have requests in this format
	ENTER αα b0b1b2b3b4b5
	LEAVE ββ b0b1b2b3b4b5
	…
which represent a request to enter access level αα with card b0b1b2b3b4b5 and leave access level αα with card b0b1b2b3b4b5 (down to access level ββ).
Multiple promotions and demotions are allowed, e.g. from αα to γγ where the 8bit number γγ ≥ αα, or ββ ≤ αα.
Default access level is 00, no access.
If someone tries to leave an access level they haven't entered, then REJECT is generated.
Answers must be either "REJECT" or "PERMIT".
bX | X in { 0, …, 5 }, αα, ββ and γγ represent 8bit hex numbers.

Example given:

Let our input be as such (hex dump):
	01 | f0 0f c7 c8 89 30 |
	02 | f7 c7 03 05 e7 30 |
	0c | a7 cf 38 dd f3 05 |
	ff | ff fb fc fd cd 01 | EOF
and the stdin stream be as such (stdin, stdout)
stdin:		ENTER 01 f7c70305e730\n /* f7c70305e730 is at LEVEL 01 */
stdout:	PERMIT
stdin:		ENTER 03 a7cf38ddf305\n /* a7cf38ddf305 is at LEVEL 03 */
stdout:	PERMIT
stdin:		LEAVE 01 a7cf38ddf305\n /* a7cf38ddf305 is now at LEVEL 01 */
stdout:	PERMIT
stdin:		ENTER 05 f7c70305e730\n /* f7c70305e730 has no access at level 05 */
stdout:	REJECT
stdin:		ENTER 0b a7cf38ddf305\n /* a7cf38ddf305 is at level 0b */
stdout:	PERMIT
stdin:		LEAVE 00 a7cf38ddf305\n /* a7cf38ddf305 is at level 00, leaving */
stdout:	PERMIT
stdin:		LEAVE 0b a7cf38ddf305\n /* a7cf38ddf305 is not present */
stdout:	REJECT
stdin:		ENTER f0 a7cf38ddf305\n /* a7cf38ddf305 has no access to level f0 */
stdout:	REJECT
stdin:		LEAVE 01 fffbfcfdcd01\n /* fffbfcfdcd01 is not present */
stdout:	REJECT
stdin:		LEAVE 00 fffbfcfdcd01\n /* fffbfcfdcd01 is not present */
stdout:	REJECT
stdin:		ENTER 01 fffbfcfdcd01\n /* fffbfcfdcd01 is at level 01 */
stdout:	PERMIT
stdin:		ENTER 7a fffbfcfdcd01\n /* fffbfcfdcd01 is at level 7a */
stdout:	PERMIT
stdin:		LEAVE 01 fffbfcfdcd01\n /* fffbfcfdcd01 is now at level 01 */
stdout:	PERMIT
stdin:		LEAVE 00 fffbfcfdcd01\n /* fffbfcfdcd01 is now at level 00, leaving */
stdout:	PERMIT
stdin:		ENTER 01 fffbfcfdcd01\n /* fffbfcfdcd01 is now at level 01 */
stdout:	PERMIT
...

(hint: 2 state machines)

POSTSCRIPTVM

You may simplify the second machine by changing
	ENTER αα b0b1b2b3b4b5
	LEAVE ββ b0b1b2b3b4b5
to
	Nααb0b1b2b3b4b5
	Lββb0b1b2b3b4b5
